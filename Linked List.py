Python Library for Linked List

Linked list is a simple data structure in
 programming, which obviously is used to
 store data and retrieve it accordingly.
 To make it easier to imagine, it is more like a dynamic array
 in which data elements are linked via pointers (i.e. the present record points
 to its next record and the next one points to the record that comes after it, this goes on until
 the end of the structure) rather than being tightly packed.
